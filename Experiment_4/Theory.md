# Theory:

__Auto Correlation__ of a signal produce the highest result when the signals _fully overlapped_ on each other. So, if a delayed signal of shifted input fully overlapped on its fixed version of signal, the maximum value will be not in the middle of correlation, rather the maximum value will be in the index value same as the delay between two signals. Using this method, we can able to find the delay using Auto Correlation method for both Discrete & Continuous signal. <br>

__Z-transform__ is a method to convert Discrete Linear Time Invariant (LTI) System from Time Domain to Frequency Domain in order to make the calculation easier. Z-transform can be performed only for discrete convergence series. It is represented by,

>           X(z) = Σ𝑥[𝑛]𝑧^(−𝑛)


From Z-transform, we get an equation f(z). where the roots of the numerator are called zeros. Which is represented with 'O' & the roots of denominator are the poles. Which is represented with ‘X’ in the Z-plane.
