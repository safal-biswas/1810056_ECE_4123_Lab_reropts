# Theory:

Signal is a function that convoys information about a phenomenon. It is basically in two types. Continuous & Discreate signal. <br>

A __Continuous signal__ is a signal that varies continuously over time or space. It is represented by a continuous function that can take any value within a given range. On the other hand, a __Discreate signal__ is a signal that define only at discreate points in time or space. Which is represented by a sequence of values, where each value corresponds to a specific time or location. <br>

There are some __Singularity functions__ which are the basis of every functions & also used in Heaviside operation. They are Unit Step Function, Unit Impulse & Ramp Function. <br>

__Unit Step Function__ denoted by ___u(t)___, where u(t) = 1 (at t>=0) & zero otherwise.<br>

__Unit Impulse Function__ is also called Dirac delta. It is function at certain location with no area inside the function & infinite in the length. It is the differentiation of the Unit Step Function. It is denoted by ___Δ(t)___, where Δ(t)=infinite or ideally one for mathematical calculation & zero otherwise. <br>

__Ramp function__ is a function with linearly increasing with time. Basically, it is the integration of the Unit Step Function. It is represented by ___r(t)___.
