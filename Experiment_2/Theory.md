# Theory:

Convolution is a mathematical tool to combining two signals to form a third signal. Convolution of ___x(t)___ with ___h(t)___ , where __h(t) = T[δ(t)]__ is denoted by __x(t) * δ(t)__. Mathematical representation of convolution is:

>      x(t) = ∫x(τ)δ(t-τ)dτ

<br>

In __Matrix Method__ of calculating the convolution, there are two number of sequences of discreate signal, a matrix has been formed by cross multiplying every element. Then addition of every of-diagonal element is taken as the result of the convolution of the following two discreate signal. <br>

This method is occurred for Linear Invariant System or LTI. So, it is called linear convolution.
