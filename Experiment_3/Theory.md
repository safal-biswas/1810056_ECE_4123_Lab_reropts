# Theory:

Correlation is the relation or combined form of a signal & time shifted form of another signal. This relation may perform on a single signal, where one of them is time shifted from. Which is called __Autocorrelation__. Or in between two different signals. Which is called __Cross Correlation__. <br>

Correlation is a mathematical tool to find the relation between signals. Mathematical representation of Autocorrelation of the function x(t):
>    R<sub>xx</sub>(τ) = ∫x(t)x'(t-τ)dt

<br>

Cross Correlation is almost similar to Autocorrelation. But instead of using a single signal, there is two signal x(t) & y(t) have been used. Mathematical representation of Autocorrelation of is:
>    R<sub>xy</sub>(τ) = ∫x(t)y'(t-τ)dt

<br>

In __Graphical Method__ of calculating the Correlation, there are two number of sequences of discreate signal. Fix one of the signals & sliding the other signal from one side to another. In each step, multiply the corresponding columns & add the multiplied row to get the particular results.
