## Implementation of Z-Transform for Causal, Anti-Causal & Non-Causal Signal

<br><br>



# Theory:

__Z-transform__ is a method to convert Discrete Linear Time Invariant (LTI) System from Time Domain to Frequency Domain in order to make the calculation easier. Z-transform can be performed only for discrete convergence series. It is represented by,

>           X(z) = Σ𝑥[𝑛]𝑧^(−𝑛)




__Causal Signal__ is the signal with values form zero to positive infinity. No negative values are included in Causal Signal with ROC of entire Z-Plane except z=0.
<br>

__Anti-Causal Signal__ is the signal with values form smallest negative to negative infinity. No positive values including zero (0) are included in Anti-Causal Signal with ROC of entire Z-Plane except z=∞.
<br>

__Non-Causal Signal__ is the signal with values form negative infinity to positie infinity. All Real values are included in the signal with ROC of entire Z-Plane except z=0 & z=∞.
